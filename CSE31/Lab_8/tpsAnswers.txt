13. To update the next input argument, we need to subtract 2 from the current argument value and store it in register $a0 before jumping to the recursion label. We can use the instruction "addi $a0, $a0, -2" to achieve this.
14. After returning from the second recursion call, we need to add the returned values in $v0 and $t0 and store the result in $v0 before jumping to the end_recur label. We can use the instruction "add $v0, $v0, $t0" to accomplish this.
15. Before returning to main, the value that needs to be retrieved is the return address, which is stored in register $ra. We need to use the instruction "jr $ra" to return to the correct location in the code. This instruction should be placed under the end_recur label.
