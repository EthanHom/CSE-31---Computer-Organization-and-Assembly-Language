int num = 0, evenNum = 0, evenCount = 0, oddNum = 0, oddCount = 0, mod = 0, sum = 0, result = 0, count = 1;
Ask user for number (num)
While loop as long as the user input is not zero (num != 0):
       Add the numbers together
       Num mod 10
	While loop for the number /10 not equal to zero
       sum += mod
       num/10
       num mod 10 
	if the sum is even, add the numbers to evenNum and add one to evenCount
	else, add the numbers to oddNum and add one to oddcount
	
	for numbers such as 1, to get “st”, if statement: count mod 10 equal to 1 and count mod 100 is not equal to 11
	do the same for “nd” and “rd” but change 1 and 11 to 2/12, 3/13
	
	ask user for number
print the averages, if there is no number, do not print
